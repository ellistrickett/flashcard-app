    },
    {
      "front": "What is the NAND gate, and why is it important?",
      "back": "The NAND gate outputs true unless all inputs are true. It is functionally complete, meaning it can implement any Boolean function."

    {
      "front": "What is the primary structure of the decimal numeral system?",
      "back": "The decimal system is based on powers of 10, with each position representing a power of 10 (e.g., 10^3, 10^2, 10^1, 10^0)."
    },
    {
      "front": "Why is binary important in computing?",
      "back": "Binary is important because digital circuits in processors use two states (on and off), represented as 1 and 0, to perform computations."
    },
    {
      "front": "How do you convert a binary number to decimal?",
      "back": "Multiply each binary digit by 2 raised to its position power, starting from 0 on the right, and sum the results."
    },
    {
      "front": "What are the benefits of using hexadecimal over binary?",
      "back": "Hexadecimal is more compact and user-friendly than binary, making it easier to read and write while preserving the same information."
    },
    {
      "front": "What is the hexadecimal color model?",
      "back": "The hexadecimal color model represents colors using #RRGGBB, where each color (Red, Green, Blue) is specified with two hexadecimal digits."
    },
    {
      "front": "What is the purpose of a logic gate?",
      "back": "Logic gates perform basic logical functions and are the building blocks of digital circuits, operating based on input values (true/false)."
    },
    {
      "front": "What are the main Boolean operations?",
      "back": "NOT (negation), AND (conjunction), and OR (disjunction) are the primary Boolean operations, each with specific precedence rules."
    },
    {
      "front": "What is functional completeness in logic gates?",
      "back": "Functional completeness means a gate (e.g., NAND or NOR) can be used to implement any Boolean function."
    },
    {
      "front": "What is the role of a full adder in computing?",
      "back": "A full adder adds binary numbers, accounting for carry values from previous stages, and outputs the sum and carry."
    },
    {
      "front": "How does a half adder differ from a full adder?",
      "back": "A half adder adds two binary digits and outputs the sum and carry, but it does not account for carry inputs from previous stages."

    {
      "front": "What is the significance of George Boole's work?",
      "back": "George Boole's work laid the foundation for Boolean algebra, which is essential for modern computing and digital logic design."

    {
      "front": "What are the limitations of ISO/IEC-8859 encoding?",
      "back": "ISO/IEC-8859 encodings are limited to 256 characters and can conflict when using characters from multiple language systems."
    },
    {
      "front": "What does the XOR gate do?",
      "back": "The XOR gate outputs true if one and only one of its inputs is true; otherwise, it outputs false."

    },
    {
      "front": "What is the role of the NOT gate in logic circuits?",
      "back": "The NOT gate inverts its input; it outputs true when the input is false, and vice versa."
